# Rock Paper Scissors

The rock paper scissor game goes back a long way. Everyone is familiar with it from every corner of the world. The goal of the webpage was to create this game using javaScript and make it an interactive and fun experience for everyone. Upon selection of one of the three available buttons, users will be able to interact with the computer by picking either the rock, paper, or scissors option. As this is an online game, it can be enjoyed alone and by anyone.

When the user opens the webpage, the website logo is the first image that will catch their attention. It is large and stands out as it identifies the game to them immediately. As they will immediately know what it is that they are going to play once they open the webpage. When creating the logo I thought about the color scheme and decided on white for the text and I used rgb(68, 128, 240) for the background. I feel that this make the logo stand out.
